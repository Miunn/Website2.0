    title: About me
    text: I've been passionate about computer science and cybersecurity for 5 years. I learned programming as a self-taught when I was in high school. Now, I'm in my third-year of a five-year master's-level course in Higher Education. I will graduate with a French engineering degree specialized in computer science and cybersecurity at INSA Hauts-de-France.<br><br><br>I started learning programming in high school by learning the Python programming language. I did some science projects like as a PI calculator with colliding blocks. I continued by learning the C language to do advanced graphics applications. Then I wanted to build applications on mobile phones so I learned Java with XML to build native Android apps using Android Studio. In order to build web applications I learnt about the Flask framework in Python and Symfony in PHP.
